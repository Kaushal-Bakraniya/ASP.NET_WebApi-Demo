## Functionality

- **Insert:** Can add new records to the system.
- **Update:** Can modify existing records.
- **Delete:** Can remove records from the system.
- **View Records:** Can retrieve all records stored in the application.

## Database

- The database isn't included in the demo, so if anyone wants to use the project, they need to configure the database on their own and change the connection string accordingly.

## Note
